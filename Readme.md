## Project Description

RentableNFT Marketplace is a decentralized smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. It enables users to rent out their NFTs (gaming items, metaverse assets, utility tokens) in a secure and automated manner. The contract manages NFT escrow, rental payments, and ensures the NFT is returned to the owner after the rental period, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

## Project Vision

Our goal is to create a transparent, trustless, and user-friendly NFT rental ecosystem. We aim to:

- **Empower NFT Owners**: Monetize digital assets by renting them out securely
- **Simplify Rentals**: Automate the rental process with smart contracts and escrow
- **Ensure Security**: NFTs are held in escrow and returned automatically after rental
- **Promote Transparency**: All transactions and rental terms are recorded on-chain
- **Enable Innovation**: Lay the foundation for advanced NFT utility and sharing models

## Future Scope

The RentableNFT Marketplace is designed for extensibility. Planned enhancements include:

### Phase 2 - Advanced Rental Features
- **Partial Rental Periods**: Support for early returns and dynamic pricing
- **Batch Rentals**: Rent multiple NFTs in a single transaction
- **Reputation System**: Track renter reliability and owner responsiveness

### Phase 3 - Ecosystem Integration
- **Cross-Contract Rentals**: Support for NFTs from multiple contracts
- **Marketplace UI**: Web interface for browsing and managing rentals
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Insights into rental activity and asset utilization

### Phase 4 - Community & Governance
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven decisions on rental terms and fees
- **Reward System**: Incentives for active renters and owners
- **Insurance Layer**: Optional coverage for lost or damaged NFTs
